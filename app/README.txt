How to use
==========

It's pretty god damn simple to be honest...
Just bash away at the pads and them pads will make sound. 
If you hold down a pad, you can assign a different sound to it
from the 'Pad Assignment Menu'.
Click your devices menu button (to the right of the home button)
and there are currently 2 menu items, Pitch which is pretty much
self-explanatory and Themes which enables you to change to a snazzy
theme I have put together for you users out there.
